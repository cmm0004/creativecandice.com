      	<h2>Navigating Reputational Risk and the Waves of Public Opinion on Social Media</h2>
		<p><em>Posted on June 18, 2014 by Candice McCollough</em></p>
		<p>Social media is how modern companies connect with customer, employees, investors and partners.
		Every moment is an opportunity to strengthen business connections, and each missed or 
		bumbled opportunity brings the risk of weakening them. Connecting with people on such a public
		 platform can be like steering your organization into very rough waters, knowing how to 
		 successfully navigate the storm is critical. Just recently Delta Airlines dealt with a 
		 brief controversy on Twitter when they posted a picture of the statue of liberty and a 
		 giraffe in response to the USA defeating Ghana at the World cup. Except there are no 
		 giraffes in Ghana, something that hundreds of clever twitter users were quick to quip.</p>

<p>While Delta’s giraffe gaffe seems harmless and easily remedied with a quick apology,
 the issue illustrates how easily controversy about your company can be stirred up without 
 careful management and oversight of social media. It may seem like a task best delegated 
 to the intern and forgotten about, a silly extra facet of modern business, but forward-thinking 
 audit committee chairs taking an active role in managing the reputational risk of social media 
 need to ask their audit committee these simple questions:</p>

<h3>1.) What are the risks we face by engaging in social media?</h3>

<p>Other than looking foolish by making public geographical mistakes, 
when you speak on social media, you speak to everyone. Commenting on almost any 
issue will cause backlash from offended groups, and opting-out entirely from 
social media isn’t an option either. 85% of customers expect businesses to be active on social media.</p>

<h3>2.) If an incident occurs, how to we mitigate reputation risk?</h3>

<p>Having a plan in place to handle social media controversies
 is key. Being watchful of reactions to your content and being 
 quick to respond and apologize for mistakes is often all that 
 is required. Ignoring or not being aware of a problem will only
  inflame the issue.  53% of surveyed twitter users said they 
  would expect a response from a brand within an hour. That 
  number jumps to 72% if the customer is waiting for a response for a complaint.</p>
<h3>3.) Does the board have the technical know-how to effectively use and co-ordinate social media campaigns?</h3>

<p>Taking active command in a social media campaign is the best 
way for high level managers and directors to monitor reputational
 risk. While it may be more efficient to off-load the work of social
 media to your marketing dept, understanding the basics of popular media 
 platforms lets you dive right in when an incident occurs to keep communication
  in-line with your brand’s mission.</p>

<p>Often times, social media is an under-exploited resource. 
It provides an opportunity to show the humans behind your brand 
and build customer and partner trust. With active management and 
the oversight of your audit committee, taking the reputational risk 
of social media will pay out dividends of reputational rewards.</p>
