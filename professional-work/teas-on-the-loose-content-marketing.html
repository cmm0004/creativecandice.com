<h3>The Short and Long of Oolong</h3>
<p><em>Posted on June 21, 2014 by Candice M.</em></p>	
<h4>And is it monkey-picked? (probably not. pg.237 <a target="_blank" href="https://encrypted.google.com/books?oe=UTF-8&id=yEQQAAAAYAAJ&q=237#v=onepage&q&f=false">here</a>)</h4>



<p>When I talk to different people about tea, 
one of the standard questions they have is to ask what’s the deal with Oolong tea?</p>

<p>So let’s take a few pixels and explain just what this tea is, 
how it’s made, and why you should be drinking it.</p>

<p>The quick answer is that Oolong is the half-way point between green 
and black tea in terms of oxidation and intensity. But that answer would 
never be sufficient for me, so let’s dig a little deeper:</p>

          			src="./imgs/jade-oolong-and-tea-cup.jpg" 
          			alt="Teas on the Loose"/>

<p>Oolongs, like all true teas—white, green, Oolong, black, 
and dark—start out life as leaves on the Camellia Sinensis plant.
 The differences between the tea types comes down to how the leaves
  are processed after harvesting. Leaves to become Oolong—a version of
   the words ‘wu’ and ‘lung’ meaning ‘black’ and ‘dragon’—are first hand-plucked
    and then laid out in the sun for a few hours to whither and begin to oxidize,
     changing the color of the leaves. Once the leaves reach the perfect balance of
      oxidation, they are fired in hot woks to stop the fermentation process and dry
       them. The final product is a crisp, beautifully wrinkled leaf that slowly unfurls
        and regains its shape once added to the hot water in your teapot.</p>

          			src="./imgs/oolong-tea-on-the-loose.jpg" 
          			alt="Teas on the Loose"/>

<p>Oolongs come in a spectrum of colors and intensities depending
 on how long the leaf was left to whither. The Chinese Iron Goddess of
  Mercy Oolong is a grassy, herbal-like tea closer in taste to a green,
   while the Taiwanese Formosa Oolongs sit closer to black teas with their
    amber liquid and deeper, floral taste. They also can be made with a variety
     of added flavors—the most popular:Jasmine.</p>

<p>Steeping time can be tricky with an Oolong, but a good rule of thumb is to 
never use boiling water and the more it looks like a green tea, the more it should 
be steeped like one to avoid the tea becoming bitter. 2 minutes at 180ºF is a safe place
 for most Oolongs.</p>

<p>The next question I get after explaining all that is to ask what the benefits of Oolong 
are, and why someone should drink it over any other tea. Since all teas come from the same 
place, preferences in teas mostly come down to taste preferences, but there are a few distinct
 qualities to an Oolong. Other than the meditative zen-time from making a full leaf tea, 
 Oolongs offer moderate caffeine content and make perfect afternoon sipping teas. The less 
 oxidized varieties contain some of the same compound touted in green teas—catechin. And their 
 floral flavors make them a perfect compliment to light foods.</p>

<p>Oolongs are a complex facet of global tea consumption, coming in a variety of flavors 
and flaunting a showy leaf-shape. Sip it in the afternoon to refresh from earlier in the day,
 or pair it with your favorite salad or crisp pastry!</p>

<h2>Social Media Presence</h2>
<p>I also run the day to day of the <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/TeasontheLoose">twitter</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://instagram.com/teasontheloose">instagram</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pinterest.com/teasontheloose/">Pinterest</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/teasontheloose">facebook</a> pages for Teas on the Loose. The majority of updates happen around 
blog posts on the site, but I also participate in tea related twitter parties and notice an uptick in interaction during those events. In particular, I've noticed an almost perfect 3 to 1 ratio of follows to followbacks on twitter.</p>
