      	<h1 class="candice-aside">I was asked to provide guidance on the re-design of the UI of our main product.</h1>
      	</div><!--end <div class="col-lg-8">-->
      	</div><!--end <div class="row">-->
      	<p>I created a set of high-fidelity mock-ups based on screenshots of the (then) current UI, using Photoshop.</p>
      	<p>Because the product was already built, I was quite limited to any structural changes I thought should be made, however I made some styling tweaks and suggestions for enhancing 
      	the UX by reducing the number of pages a customer is required to click through.</p>
      	
      	
<h2>The Start Screen</h2>
<p>Or the About Screen, was the only screen that I was given a set of things that needed changing,
 specifically the way the text and logos were arranged on the left side of the screen.</p>
<p class="lead">The original:</p>
<img class="img-responsive" 
          			
          			
          			src="./imgs/aruvio-product-original.jpg" 
          			alt="aruvio product original"/>
          			
<p class="lead">My changes:</p>
<img class="img-responsive" 
          			
          			
          			src="./imgs/aruvio-product-1.jpg" 
          			alt="aruvio product about screen"/>
<p>Changes made to the menu/ header area:</p>   			
<ol>
<li>I moved the menu links to the right side 
to consolidate the buttons. I think it makes 
more sense for the menu buttons and the log-out 
button to be on the same side of the page.</li>

<li>Menu buttons have icons and are in a ‘pill’ 
format. Bootstrap has the css for pill buttons. </li>

<li>Active, inactive, and hover states are in brand colors. </li>

<li>logout/ username is higher on the page and include a ‘Welcome, 
username’ A small change, but it makes it seem more accessible.</li>

<li>Removed blue bar and extended light blue header.</li>

<li>Updated the logo to the new one with ‘a virima company’ at the bottom.</li>
</ol>

<p>Changes made to the content area:</p>
<ol>
<li>Made text bigger.</li>
<li>removed the frames. They aren’t necessary and they date the design.</li>

<li>At least 5px padding around the video.</li>
</ol>

<h2>The Regulatory Gap Process Screens</h2>

<p>The header is not seen in these screens because it is above the fold.</p>

<p class="lead">The original:</p>
<img class="img-responsive" 
          			
          			
          			src="./imgs/aruvio-product-original-reg-page.jpg" 
          			alt="aruvio product regulations"/>
          			
          			
<p class="lead">My changes:</p>
<img class="img-responsive" 
          			
          			
          			src="./imgs/aruvio-product-3.jpg" 
          			alt="aruvio product regulations"/>
 <p>Changes to Navigation</p>   
<ol>
<li>Removed the configuarable description that was underneath the blue bar.</li>

<li>Changed the blue bar to an aruvio blue. I’ll include those colors at the end.</li>

<li>Moved ‘Select previously saved requirements profile’ to the top under the first radio button selection.</li>
<li>Made the buttons a little nicer, and moved then to the right side to keep with the new paradigm of ‘clickables to the right’</li>

<li>Inactive, active and ‘cancel’ states to allow for easier navigation. Also added icons for ‘previous’ and ‘next’.</li>
</ol>
<p>Changes to content</p>
<ol>
<li>I think it would make sense to combine the first 2 steps into one page.
 Just do your claims on the left side and then be able to do the supplier’s claims on the 
 right side. I think it would be alot faster than having two separate pages to do that. I've added the supplier's dialogue 
 here to show that.</li>

</ol>


<h2>Gaps Review Screen</h2>
<p class="lead">The original:</p>
<img class="img-responsive" 
          			
          			
          			src="./imgs/aruvio-product-original-gaps-page.jpg" 
          			alt="aruvio product regulations"/>
          			
          			
<p class="lead">My changes:</p>
<img class="img-responsive" 
          			
          			
          			src="./imgs/aruvio-product-4.jpg" 
          			alt="aruvio product gaps regulations"/>
<p>Changes to Styling</p>   
<ol>
<li>The lines surronding the table elements were yellow, here are aruvio green.</li>

<li>The gradient on the table was white to grey, here white to light green, one of our brand colors.</li>
</ol>
