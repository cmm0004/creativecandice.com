<h2>The Home Page Slider</h2>
<p>Among small changes, like making the logo bigger, adding contact information across the top, adding side navigation, and re-arranging the contents of the header menu, the biggest change to the homepage has been the slider</p>
<p>When I came onboard, the slider was stock potos of business people and a call to submit your information for a demo, but the user wouldn't even have had time to know what Aruvio was selling, why would they submit thier information?</p>
<p>From a usability perspective, the form on the slider had some issues: if you input invalid data (forgot the '@' in your email) then an error message would appear and push the fields below it off canvas and a user would have to refresh the 
page in order to submit the form. I offered to change the display of the error messages, but my Marketing Manager wanted a complete overhaul of the slider, completely removing the forms
and focusing on our value proposition.</p>
<p class="lead">The old look:</p>
	
          	<img class="img-responsive" 
          			
          			
          			src="./imgs/old-home-page.jpg" 
          			alt="aruvio old home page"/>
   <p class="lead">The new look:</p>
          			<img class="img-responsive" 
          			
          			
          			src="./imgs/new-home-page.jpg" 
          			alt="aruvio new homepage"/>
    <p>The slider is animated, so best to <a href="http://www.aruvio.com" target="_blank">view it in action</a>.</p>
    <p>The font and size of the text has been updated, we now use Roboto in headers and Open Sans for our content text, and I've increased 
    the size of our content text for readability. I've made the text a dark grey and reserved the 'aruvio blue & green' for graphics and buttons. The objective was to create a clean, easy to understand website,
     and that's just what I've done.</p>
     
     <h2>Highlighting Product Benefits</h2>
     <p>When I can on-board, the website was mostly walls of text, and I was asked to create separate areas on each product page to draw attention to the benefits of each. So, using a plugin for bootstrap's css I made little widget-like areas
      that had our 'aruvio check-mark' and the list of benefits.</p>
      <img class="img-responsive" 
          			
          			
          			src="./imgs/benefits-widget.jpg" 
          			alt="aruvio benefits"/>
          			
          			
      
    <h2>Call to Action: SC Magazine</h2>
    
    <p>A point of pride for Aruvio's GRC product is its 4 out of 5 stars from SC Magazine, so I was asked to create a call to action at the bottom of every product page 
    to download the review from SC Magazine. This is done in pure HTML/CSS, so the text could be selectable and I could use the bootstrap button. Used my working knowledge of php to add it to every
    page by adding it directly to the template we use for product pages.</p>
    
    <img class="img-responsive" 
          			
          			
          			src="./imgs/sc-magazine-cta.jpg" 
          			alt="aruvio sc magazine"/>
          			
    <h2>In-Text Call to Actions</h2>
    <p>We have a number of downloadables, and to increase user's awareness of them, I added graphical call-to-actions for a relevant downloadable 
    on each product page.</p>
    <p class="lead">An example of the Incident Management Call to Action</p>
    <img class="img-responsive" 
          			
          			
          			src="./imgs/in-line-cta.jpg" 
          			alt="aruvio cta's"/>
          			
    <h2>Header Banners</h2>
    <p>I created a series of banners for the heading of each product page. The icons are used to represent the different products 
    on a number of other applications as well, including on a slide of the home page carousel, and the powerpoint deck for our sales team.</p>

          			src="./imgs/risk-header.jpg" 
          			alt="risk management header"/>
          			  <img class="img-responsive"

          			  <img class="img-responsive"
